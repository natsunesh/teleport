Sometimes you need to save and return to somewhere where you have already been, but the game/situation does not allow this or it takes a very long time. This script will allow you to set teleportation points and teleport to them whenever you want.

for works use this link:
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/natsunesh/teleport.git"))()
